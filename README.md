This repo is archived because it was doing too much. The scraper and the generated pages should not live in the same repo.

The jobpages repo now is: [jobs](https://github.com/binarygit/jobs)

The scraper now lives at: [job_scraper](https://github.com/binarygit/job_scraper)

The command line utility to display the jobs in the command line itself lives at: [show-job](https://github.com/binarygit/show-job)
